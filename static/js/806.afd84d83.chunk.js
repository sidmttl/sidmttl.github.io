The competitors like IBM and Apple couldn\u2019t sustain long, leading to Microsoft being unmatched by its position. After a strong run, gradually the culture of the company accumulated inefficiencies. The teams in the organization behaved like gang factions. There was an increase in company politics and the hierarchy was very rigid, inhibiting innovation. After Windows, Office and OS for servers (Windows NT), Microsoft lost the mobile phones battle with Android even after buying Nokia, and the cloud battle with AWS serving customers before Microsoft even formed it\u2019s cloud team. It was around that time Satya Nadella was declared the CEO of Microsoft.\n\\\n\\\nSatya had seen Microsoft for a long time as he joined before .com bubble formed.  His vision was to make Microsoft **cloud first**, **mobile first**. Secondly, he wanted to transform the culture, to remove the inhibitions of innovation and invigorate the sense of purpose in employees. And that transformation should come from within the company.\n\n---\n\n### Satya's role as CEO in the starting years\n- Communicate clearly and regularly Microsoft\u2019s sense of mission, worldview, and business and innovation ambitions.\n- Drive cultural change from top to bottom, and get the right team in the right place.\n- Build new surprising partnerships in which Microsoft can grow the pie and delight customers.\n- Be ready to catch the next wave of innovation and platform shifts. Reframe the opportunity for a mobile- and cloud-first world, and drive execution with urgency.\n- Stand for timeless values, and restore productivity and economic growth for everyone. \n\n### Management Lessons\n    \n- To bring a cultural change in a huge organization is a difficult task. It needs to be executed in a step by step manner, with transformation flowing from top to the bottom.\n- He started with building a deeper understanding among the Senior Leadership Team (SLT) by organizing an unconventional meeting. To connect everyone\u2019s **personal philosophies** to the **job they do**; the leaders in Microsoft. A company is team, when everyone in the team connects what they stand for, with the company, the team can achieve all the good things, including the change. Along with philosophies, SLT connected with each other emotionally, revealing their thoughts, experiences to each other. Some of them being intense emotions, what drives a person.\n- For the meeting, there were 2 important things. Firstly, the meeting was organized in calm, comfortable and **informal setting**. It didn\u2019t take place in the usual meeting place. When people walk in a place they are accustomed to, they get into the familiar mental zone of that place. For example, feeling comfort when entering the home building. To achieve something new, a change of place is helpful.\n- Secondly, he invited a psychologist who had trained a football teams to achieve team harmony and success. Inviting a **3rd person** can be very beneficial. The person brings his specialization with him and a fresh face. More importantly, it does not strain your relationship. For example, if a CEO asks his management to recite A, B, C, D.. or a silly thing, the management can feel uncomfortable and think CEO is weird etc. even if he mentions it\u2019s for knowing each other. However, with a 3rd person, it\u2019s that person\u2019s way of healing and management will feel confident in his intentions and method without affecting CEO\u2019s relationship.\n- However, with time a few SLT members left the company and other members were added. The leadership should have old school college discussions and should try to lean on other\u2019s problems to provide their view. A cohesive leadership is essential.\n- **Empathy** is a crucial trait which motivated Satya. \u201cIf you find a baby crying on the street alone, sooth the baby. Don\u2019t just wait for its parents\u201d. When we have empathy, we can understand how other\u2019s feel. It makes a person humble, calms the feeling of ups and downs of life and empowers to solve other people\u2019s problems with innovation. The interplay between empathy and technology is beautiful.\n- The **philosophy of existence** is central in the book. Why does Microsoft exist? What is the role of a CEO? questions like these enable us to find our purpose and spirit.  When the purpose is clear, actions have meaning. He tried to convey it in his speeches.\n- Lessons learned from cricket:\n    \n    To compete vigorously and with passion in the face of uncertainty and intimidation.\n    \n    The importance of putting your team first, ahead of your personal statistics and recognition.\n    \n    The central importance of leadership. Sometimes taking sub optimal decisions to build confidence in a player, which will go a long way\n    \n- Steve Balmer decided to invest in search, years after google so that Microsoft can gain experience in client facing products and built great technology with cloud. Satya took a very challenging responsibility because it could be detrimental to his job at Microsoft. He became the leader of the STB unit.\n- Microsoft was heavily focused on Distributed computing and servers but it didn\u2019t focus on cloud. Persuading the Distributed computing team to focus on cloud was a challenge. Satya connected to them **individually** to have a **bond** with them, before giving presentations and brainstorming with them in the cloud direction. He made sure that the cloud appears like an **extension and not the primary direction**. He proposed a hybrid solution with distributed computing and cloud to get people onboard.\n- While creating cloud, it was essential to not just provide a computation platform but to understand how people use it and give them tools to do that efficiently. Therefore, they focused on AI capability, to enable people to get analysis of the ever-growing data. Additionally, they added Linux support even when the platform is known to be their rival. It was done understanding the requirement of the consumers.\n- It is important to not always chase the competitors, like releasing windows phones seeing Apple and Android eco-systems. The focus should be on, what is the value this product can add, which others cannot provide yet.\n\n### Special moments\n\n- Buddha didn\u2019t go out to create a new religion, he went on a journey to understand why do we suffer?\n- When Anu (Satya\u2019s wife) gave birth to their first child Zain, they got to know that Zain had a non treatable disease, a major one. Satya was devastated by it, he wondered why god has done this to him and Anu. But she helped him realize, its not about what happened them, it was about what has happened to Zain. To have empathy about what he goes through.\n- He gave up his Green Card, so that Anu can join him in USA and build her career there. They both came to H1-B",y=g.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,w=function(e){var t=Object.assign({},e);return(0,m.jsx)(i.rU,(0,o.Z)({},t))},b=function(){return(0,m.jsx)(p.Z,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Siddharth Mittal",children:(0,m.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[(0,m.jsx)("header",{children:(0,m.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,m.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:(0,m.jsx)(i.rU,{to:"/blog/blog1",children:"BOOK: HIT REFRESH"})}),(0,m.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",y," words)"]})]})}),(0,m.jsx)(r(),{remarkPlugins:[f],renderers:{Link:w},children:g})]})})}}}]);
